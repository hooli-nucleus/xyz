# Hooli Nucleus XYZ (Public Beta)

> **"Making the world a better place through constructed dominant data-driven compression ecosystems."**

## About Nucleus
Welcome to the public-facing repository for **Nucleus XYZ**. 

While the core [Middle-Out Compression™](http://www.hooli.xyz) engine remains proprietary (housed safely in our air-gapped `hooli-nucleus/nucleus-core-v3` monorepo), we believe in partial transparency. 

This repository handles:
- Public issue tracking for the XYZ interface.
- Community engagement (we hear you, even if we don't listen).
- Automated triage of bugs before they reach the inner circle of Gavin Belson’s elite dev team.

## Automated Triage System 🤖
We have implemented a state-of-the-art **AI-driven** (it's just a bash script) triage bot to ensure only the most critical feedback reaches our internal servers.

- **Auto-Labeler:** If you submit a bug, our `auto-labeler.yml` will categorize it. Please do not use keywords like `urgent` unless you are a Platinum Enterprise Customer.
- **Sync Protocol:** High-value feedback is manually promoted to our internal repo via our `internal-sync.yml` pipeline. This ensures a one-way data diode of pure innovation.

## Contributing
1.  **Don't touch the compression algorithm.** You won't understand it.
2.  Submit issues if you find bugs in the UI.
3.  If your issue is deleted, it was likely deemed "non-optimal" by the Triage Bot.

## Security
Security is paramount at Hooli. We use industry-standard ephemeral tokens and obfuscated bash logic to protect our assets.
